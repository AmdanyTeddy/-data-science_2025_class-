# Calculating the Volume and Surface Area of a closed Cylinder
# Define the radius and height of the closed cylinder
radius = 3.0
height = 5.0

# Calculate the Volume of the Cylinder
volume = 3.14159 * radius ** 2 * height           

# Calculate the Surface Area of the closed Cylinder
surface_area = 2 * 3.14159 * radius * (radius + height)

# Print the Volume and Surface Area
print("Volume:", volume,  "Surface Area:", surface_area)
