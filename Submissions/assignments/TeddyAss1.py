# Define the dimensions of the rectangle

length = 8.0    # Length of the rectangle (in units)
width = 3.0     # Width of the rectangle (in units)

# Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle correctly
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Print the results
print("Area:", area)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
